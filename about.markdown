As a recent graduate of Washington State University with a degree in Computer Science and a 3.7 GPA, I am passionate about utilizing my skills to tackle complex challenges in the technology industry. Throughout my academic career, I have become well-versed in a variety of programming languages and frameworks including Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter, and SQL (PostgreSQL). I am particularly interested in the fields of web development, data science, and machine learning, and I am eager to apply my knowledge in these areas to real-world projects.
In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a range of hobbies that keep me active and engaged. I am an avid fan of sports such as basketball and soccer, both as a spectator and a player. As a coder, I enjoy using my free time to work on Leetcode problems, keeping my coding skills sharp and learning new concepts. I am also a video game enthusiast, with titles such as Witcher 3, Rocket League, and Titanfall 2 among my favorites. Additionally, I make it a priority to stay healthy by going to the gym regularly and staying active in outdoor activities.
